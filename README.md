## About Me

I'm a 21 year old UI/UX designer with a specialization in Design System Creation and Management, transitioning into Frontend development. I'm passionate about actively bringing concepts to life through implementation, not limited to design alone. 

I'm good at active listening, critical thinking, and effective communication, all aimed at solving real-world problems. Looking forward to starting a frontend development internship to get even better.
